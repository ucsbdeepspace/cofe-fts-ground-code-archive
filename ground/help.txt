--DOING STUFF--
If you want to run telemetry or the groundstation, double-click ground.py. If you don't like a setting, such as the telemetry baud rate, where telemetry dumps files, or the comm ports used by the telemetry, change the value assigned to it in Release\ground\ground.cfg.


--DIRECTORY CONTENTS--
I don't know what diodefit, gui, idl_gui, pyread, or sync do.

groundstation/ contains the code for the groundstation, including the spaceball- and fits-reshaping code.

telemetry.exe, run as "telemetry.exe FOLDER COMPORT BAUD", will listen on the given comport with the given baud rate for spaceball files, and write those to disk in the given folder.

ground.py starts high- and low-speed telemetry and the groundstation. The startup info for the telemetry codes is read from ground.cfg.
