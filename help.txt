This directory contains the executable files for COFE.

communications/ provides comm-to-ip capability and "robustness", a package that wraps sockets in such a way that they can detect and recover from interruptions in the connection. The telescope server code also lives there, since it requires robustness and I know of no clean way to import it if it's not in the same directory.

flight/ contains the code to be run on the flight computer.

ground/ contains the code to be run on the ground computer.

telescope/ contains the code to be run on the telescope computer.

On the MOKA computers, the communications, flight, and telescope directories should all be located in the same parent directory as each other.
